## Pokemon Group Gym

A group project using AJAX calls demonstrating collaboration using Github.

Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX/JSON, and Github.

Learning Objectives:

To collaborate on a pokemon gym website showcasing all chosen pokemon from the prior trainer project by utilizing libraries written by individual group members. This project is focused on client side technologies.

Upon successful completion of this project, we will demonstrate our understanding of teamwork and software engineering collaboration via Github.

Visually, is a combination of our previous individual Pokemon API projects ( [Milo's](https://mwissig.github.io/Personal-Pokedex/) / [Joesph's](https://jdworman.github.io/Personal-Pokedex/) ), using horror aesthetics and CSS TV monitors to display images and data.
